# Gator-AVL

In this project, I'm implementing an AVL tree, a type of self-balancing binary search tree, which automatically maintains its balance through rotations. Each Node contains a name, id, and pointers to its left and right children, and the AVLTree class manages the tree structure with functions for insertion, deletion, and searching. The insert() and deleteNode() methods ensure the tree remains balanced by calculating balance factors and applying left or right rotations when needed. Various traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) allow for printing the tree's contents, while the getLevelCount() function determines the tree's depth. A command-line interface in main.cpp enables user interactions to insert, remove, and search nodes by name or ID.
